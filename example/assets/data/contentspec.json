				"content": "Contemporary in design and green in attitude, this lodge sits on a wildlife-rich island 30 minutes from Adelaide. Each of the 21 suites offers limestone floors, an outdoor terrace, and works by local artisans. (Air-conditioning is unnecessary; the property was constructed to take advantage of natural weather patterns.) For a spectacular ocean view from a hand-carved granite bath, book the glass-walled Osprey Pavilion suite, which also features a private plunge spa and sunken lounge.",

				"content": "The 2 1/2-mile stretch known as White Beach is often singled out for having the softest sand in the world—and it’s the setting for this resort and its 88 suites (some with private Jacuzzis). The water’s fine, whether you want to take a dip in the infinity pool or Jet Ski on the Sibuyan Sea. For people-watching, head to the Sandbar, where bartenders stir up lychee- and mango-infused mojitos.",

Open-plan suites are done in royal blue, turquoise, and stark white to mimic the Coral Sea below, with hammocks and decks discreetly hidden from view. Count on sunset cruises, torchlit beach dinners, and complimentary gourmet picnic baskets. Book an Anchor Bay Suite for a direct pathway to the beach and daybed sunbathing from a personal veranda.",

Rooms are spread across the main building, two villas, and a triplet of honeymoon cottages and decorated with local antiques. An elevator descends to a private beach, saltwater pool, fitness center, and thatched-roof pizzeria and fish grill. As you stroll through the secluded terraced gardens and citrus orchards, it’s obvious why Liz Taylor and Richard Burton chose to hide out here.",
